I'm currently finishing my master's degree in applied econometrics at  University of São Paulo - Department of Production Engineer/São Carlos, southeast of Brazil. I'm passionate about statistics and data analysis, particularly in the applied IA field with a tendency to work with financial data. You cand find more details about my past and current work (as well as my study notebooks) in the Projects and Study tabs.

In the blog section i will write mainly about study topics towards data science and some personal projects. The content covers exercises resolutions and codes for studies/projects in R, Phyton and later on LISP/Scala.
