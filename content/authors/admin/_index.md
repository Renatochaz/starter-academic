I'm currently finishing my master's degree in applied econometrics at  University of São Paulo - Department of Production Engineer/São Carlos, southeast of Brazil. I'm passionate about statistics and data analysis, particularly in the applied IA field with a tendency to work with financial data. I'm a self learner in the IA field with focus in good online and practical content, such as doing real word applied projects, kaggle IA projects or study materials such as open MIT/Stanford courses. With that beeing said, some certified material to cover formal fundamentals are also important. My certfications are open in the [Certifications section.](#certifications)


The site is mainly about study topics and personal projects towards data science. The content covers exercises resolutions and codes for studies/projects in R, Phyton and later on LISP/Scala.

You can find more details and open codes about my past and current work (as well as my study notebooks) in the [Projects](#projects) and [Study](#study) sections.

My master's dissertation econometric research code is fully open for researches interested in studying the functional programming used in R to clean financial data, do regression models and data visualization. The most complex econometrics models using System-GMM are also avaliable in Stata language. The repository link and a short description are in the [Master's project page.]({{< ref "/project/masters_project" >}})
