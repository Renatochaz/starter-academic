# Learn SQL for Big Data environments

This repository builds on the content available at the course of Big Data with MySQL. My aim here is to consolidate the knowledge, point at fundamental topics needed to work with SQL in a Data Science context and build a place with aggregated knowledge of SQL to consult when needed.

If you want a more in depth explanation of everything explained at this repository, please go to [Link to course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/analytics-mysql).

The exercises interact with real business databases with millions of data points, feel free to study then to understand how to interact and retrieve data.

# Exercises License

All exercises from the course are licensed by NC 4.0 and are authored for Jana Schaich Borg. I don't have any connection to the instructor and I'm just sharing then for study purposes. Feel free to study the exercises, but by no means share then without giving credits or for a commercial purpose.

**Note that the exercises interact with a private database and can't be interacted from github/your local computer. They are here for a understanding of the SQL syntax only.**
