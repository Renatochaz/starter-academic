**In no way graded assignments  and exams needed to certificate will be shared due to the Coursera honor code**

The aim of my repository is to give students learning Multivariate Calculus (in special those doing the Imperial College London Mathematics for Machine Learning course) some helpful resources and somewhere to guide then in the practice exercises available at the course. 

* The shareable code and notebooks are in the [github repository](https://github.com/Renatochaz/Mathematics_for_Machine_Learning) linked in this post. Feel free to access, comment, star or fork, interactions motivate me to produce and share more content for free, and suggestions to improvement are always viewed in a positive light!

**Basic course description (From Imperial College London course)**
*This course offers a brief introduction to the multivariate calculus required to build many common machine learning techniques. We start at the very beginning with a refresher on the “rise over run” formulation of a slope, before converting this to the formal definition of the gradient of a function. We then start to build up a set of tools for making calculus easier and faster. Next, we learn how to calculate vectors that point up hill on multidimensional surfaces and even put this into action using an interactive game. We take a look at how we can use calculus to build approximations to functions, as well as helping us to quantify how accurate we should expect those approximations to be. We also spend some time talking about where calculus comes up in the training of neural networks, before finally showing you how it is applied in linear regression models. This course is intended to offer an intuitive understanding of calculus, as well as the language necessary to look concepts up yourselves when you get stuck. Hopefully, without going into too much detail, you’ll still come away with the confidence to dive into some more focused machine learning courses in future.*
