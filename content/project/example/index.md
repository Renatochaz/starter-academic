*** This is a private work, data isn't avaliable and identification of the client is omitted ***

A local supermarket chain was interested in forecasting their produce section, they manually estimated when to buy and had a huge waste of food going bad before selling.

Their database had over 20 years of information from all stores, the data was unustructured when minned. We made a functional code to structure the data and propposed a SARIMA model with paramater variation for every item in the produce section.

The model worked out in mixed ways for the items, some were analyzed to be totally random and the model coudn't predict accuratelly, while some had a accuracy of over 95%.

Full disclosure of the project details isn't possible due to the private nature of the work, for further inquiries about the specifics of the project contact me at: renato.ch@usp.br
